    "# # CIRA Simple Workflow Example\n",
    "# \n",
    "# This notebook demonstrates a simple workflow using the CIRA library, covering:\n",
    "# 1. Setting up API keys.\n",
    "# 2. Fetching historical stock data.\n",
    "# 3. Running a basic strategy backtest.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ## 1. API Key Setup\n",
    "# \n",
    "# To use CIRA with Alpaca Markets for live trading or to fetch most data, you need to set your API keys.\n",
    "# You can do this in two ways:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# **Method 1: Set keys directly in your script (DO NOT COMMIT YOUR KEYS TO VERSION CONTROL)**\n",
    "\n",
    "# %% \n",
    "import cira\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option 1: Set keys directly (replace with your actual keys)\n",
    "# Ensure you have a .env file or environment variables set for APCA_ID and APCA_KEY if you run this often\n",
    "# or store them securely.\n",
    "# cira.auth.set_api_keys(\"YOUR_APCA_ID\", \"YOUR_APCA_KEY\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option 2: Use a key file (JSON format)\n",
    "# Create a JSON file (e.g., /path/to/your/alpaca_keys.json) with:\n",
    "# {\n",
    "#   \"APCA-API-KEY-ID\": \"YOUR_APCA_ID\",\n",
    "#   \"APCA-API-SECRET-KEY\": \"YOUR_APCA_KEY\"\n",
    "# }\n",
    "# cira.auth.set_key_file_path(\"/path/to/your/alpaca_keys.json\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option 3: Use environment variables (Recommended for security)\n",
    "# CIRA will automatically try to load APCA_ID and APCA_KEY from your environment variables.\n",
    "# This is the most secure way if you are running this in a shared environment or version control.\n",
    "# For this example, we'll try to use them if they exist, otherwise, it will rely on manual setup above.\n",

    "# \n",
    "# This notebook has demonstrated a basic workflow with CIRA:\n",
    "# 1.  **API Key Setup:** Crucial for most functionalities. Remember to handle your keys securely.\n",
    "# 2.  **Fetching Data:** Showed how to get historical stock data. CIRA also supports fetching data for options and cryptocurrencies.\n",
    "# 3.  **Backtesting:** Ran a simple `ByAndHold` strategy. You can create your own custom strategies by inheriting from `cira.strategy.Strategy` and implementing the `iterate` method. Explore other built-in strategies and the `multi_strategy_backtest` function.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ### Further Exploration:\n",
    "# *   **Different Assets:** Try fetching data for other stocks, options, or cryptocurrencies (e.g., `cira.Cryptocurrency(\"BTC/USD\")`).\n",
    "# *   **Custom Strategies:** Develop and test your own trading strategies. Refer to the CIRA documentation and examples for guidance.\n",
    "# *   **Live Trading:** Once you are comfortable with your strategies (after thorough backtesting and paper trading), you might explore CIRA's capabilities for placing trades through Alpaca. **Always exercise extreme caution with live trading and understand the risks involved.**\n",
    "# *   **Error Handling:** This notebook includes basic error handling. Robust applications would require more comprehensive error management.\n",
    "# *   **Advanced Features:** Explore other CIRA modules for portfolio management, exchange information, etc.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# We hope this example helps you get started with CIRA! Check out the official [CIRA GitHub repository](https://github.com/AxelGard/cira) for more examples, documentation, and discussions.\n",
